/**
 * A {@link Closeable} that collects {@code Closeable} resources and closes them all when it is
 * {@linkplain #close closed}. This is intended to approximately emulate the behavior of Java 7's <a
 * href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html"
 * >try-with-resources</a> statement in JDK6-compatible code. Running on Java 7, code using this
 * should be approximately equivalent in behavior to the same code written with try-with-resources.
 * Running on Java 6, exceptions that cannot be thrown must be logged rather than being added to the
 * thrown exception as a suppressed exception.
 *
 * <p>This class is intended to be used in the following pattern:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Closer closer = Closer.create();
 * try {
 *   InputStream in = closer.register(openInputStream());
 *   OutputStream out = closer.register(openOutputStream());
 *   // do stuff
 * } catch (Throwable e) {
 *   // ensure that any checked exception types other than IOException that could be thrown are
 *   // provided here, e.g. throw closer.rethrow(e, CheckedException.class);
 *   throw closer.rethrow(e);
 * } finally {
 *   closer.close();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note that this try-catch-finally block is not equivalent to a try-catch-finally block using
 * try-with-resources. To get the equivalent of that, you must wrap the above code in <i>another</i>
 * try block in order to catch any exception that may be thrown (including from the call to {@code
 * close()}).
 *
 * <p>This pattern ensures the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each {@code Closeable} resource that is successfully registered will be closed later.
 *   <li>If a {@code Throwable} is thrown in the try block, no exceptions that occur when attempting
 *       to close resources will be thrown from the finally block. The throwable from the try block
 *       will be thrown.
 *   <li>If no exceptions or errors were thrown in the try block, the <i>first</i> exception thrown
 *       by an attempt to close a resource will be thrown.
 *   <li>Any exception caught when attempting to close a resource that is <i>not</i> thrown (because
 *       another exception is already being thrown) is <i>suppressed</i>.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>An exception that is suppressed is not thrown. The method of suppression used depends on the
 * version of Java the code is running on:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Java 7+:</b> Exceptions are suppressed by adding them to the exception that <i>will</i>
 *       be thrown using {@code Throwable.addSuppressed(Throwable)}.
 *   <li><b>Java 6:</b> Exceptions are suppressed by logging them instead.
 * </ul>
